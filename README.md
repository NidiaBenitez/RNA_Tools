# RNA_Tools

## Introduction

In this repository you will find the python script of the software  tool called "All_In_One_shRNA_Generator".

## Technical details

* The software was developed using Python v3.5
* The software GUI was developed using PyQt5

## Requirenments to run the script
### **Windows** [Instructive video](https://youtu.be/jG7qKrKMu8M)

Before running the script in Windows you need to download:

1. [Python version 3.5.0](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/python-3.5.0.exe)
2. [PyQt5 version 5.6.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt5/PyQt-5.6/PyQt5-5.6-gpl-Py3.5-Qt5.6.0-x32-2.exe/download)
3. [SSD Software script](/download/siRNA_and_shRNA_designer_(SSD)_release_v1.0.zip)

The order of the installations must be followed as shown below.

#### Installing Python3.5

These are the files that we have after downloading the previous files

#### Running the script on windows

Once you have downloaded the zipped file that is inside the Python script you will see something like this:

![](/images/runnig_the_script_000.png)

First **right click** on the zipped file and press the **Extract Here** option.

Then you will have the Python script unzipped. To run it you just need to **double click** on the script and it will run.

##### NOTES:
If you cannot run the script by double-clicking on it, try changing the file extension from **py** to **pyw**, or just use the **prompt** command  to run it.

### **Linux (Ubuntu)** [Instructive video](https://youtu.be/FC1ttM7NY-0)

Before running the script on Windows, you need to download:

1. PIP3
2. PyQt5
3. [SSD Software script](/download/siRNA_and_shRNA_designer_(SSD)_release_v1.0.zip)

First, you need to check the version of python3 installed in your device by typing the command:
````
python3 --version
````

![](/images/installation_pip3.png)

Once you have typed in the command and pressed enter, the terminal will return the version of python3 that is installed in your device, like this:

![](/images/installation_pip3_00.png)

The next step is to update and upgrade the system in order to install pip3:

````
sudo apt-get update
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_04.png)

````
sudo apt-get upgrade
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_05.png)

The system will show you how to install pip3 by running this command:
````
pip3
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_01.png)

You have to copy, paste and run the command displayed on the terminal.

![](/images/installation_pip3_03.png)

You can check the pip3 version using:
````
pip3 -V
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_06.png)

Next, we need to install PyQt5, through the command:
````
pip3 install pyqt5
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_07.png)

#### Running the script on Linux (Ubuntu)

Open the directory where your target script is and right click on it, and select **Open on terminal**.
Then type the following command:
````
python3 siRNA\ and\ shRNA\ designer\ (SSD\)_release_v1.0.py
````
