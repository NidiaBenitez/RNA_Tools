# RNA_Tools

## Introduction

In this repository you will find the python script of software called "All_In_One_shRNA_Generator".

## Technical details

* The software was developed using Python v3.5
* The software GUI was developed using PyQt5

## Requirenments before run the script
### **Windows** [Instructive video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0S5jYU3vnU)

Before to run the script in Windows you need to download:

3. [SSD Software script](/download/siRNA_and_shRNA_designer_(SSD)_release_v1.0.zip)

The orther of the installations must be follows as shown.

#### Installing Python3.5

### **Linux (Ubuntu)** [Instructive video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC1ttM7NY-0)

Before to run the script in Windows you need to download:

1. PIP3
2. PyQt5
3. [SSD Software script](/download/siRNA_and_shRNA_designer_(SSD)_release_v1.0.zip)

First you need to checke the version of python3 you have using the command:
````
python3 --version
````

![](/images/installation_pip3.png)

You have to see the version you have installed like this:

![](/images/installation_pip3_00.png)

Next step is to update and upgrade the system in order to install pip3:

````
sudo apt-get update
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_04.png)

````
sudo apt-get upgrade
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_05.png)

The system will show you how to install pip3 just runnin this command:
````
pip3
````

You can check the pip3 version using:
````
pip3 -V
````

![](/images/installation_pip3_06.png)

After that we need to install PyQt5, so it will be done with command:
````
pip3 install pyqt5
````

#### Running the script on Linux (Ubuntu)

Open the directory where is you script target and the right click and select **Open on terminal**.
Then type the following command:
````
python3 siRNA\ and\ shRNA\ designer\ (SSD\)_release_v1.0.py
````
